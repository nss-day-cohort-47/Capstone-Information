* A single page app created with React
* **CRUD** is an easy way to get there
* Capstone should include `relational` data
* Capstone needs to be approved by Brenda (or other senior instructor)

Once you have a completed proposal, you will meet with an instruction team member to confirm your realistic MVP.



### DEADLINES
* **Beginning Now** Share your initial idea with Brenda and get 👍 thumbs-up.

* **Friday 04/23/2021:** Last Day for Final Capstone Proposals, see [instructions](./02-capstone-proposal..md). **Sooner is better**. We have to review all proposals and have 1-on-1's with each of you.

* **Ongoing** As complete proposals are received, 1-on-1s with mentor to determine realistic MVP.

* **Thursday 05/06/2021:** That last day for MVP approval. **Sooner is better**.

	3. **After lead instructor approval you may work on stretch goals!**
